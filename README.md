# Security Bridge

## Project deliverable

2 main deliverables:

- "Ressource Hub", which are markdown files in the Github repo that offer training materials and tools for employees to easily access and share with their peers and teams. The focus is to raise awareness and to equip professionals in the Application Security industry (and beyond) with the necessary knowledge, tools & guidance to help prevent burnout & build greater resilience; essential to overall mental health & wellbeing. 

- "Online community space" by using Github Discussions to have a forum for professionals of our industry to exchange about 3 main areas focusing on wellbeing and resilience (as a start):

What are some things you do that help you in a stressful situation?

Share some of the things you do that support your mental health & wellbeing.

What do you to wind down at the end of your day?

Sharing stories will help to build up resiliency individually and as a community. 

Describe your project
"Security Bridge" is aiming to build bridges in our community to not only talk and learn about application security but also the daily challenges we are facing that are non-technical.

The main goal is: "Connecting Cyber Security Professional to nurture a resilient cyber security community."

There are 4 areas that should be covered by this project:

1. Understand & Identify Stress (Mental Overwhelm) & Burnout 
2. Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) for Managing Burnout & Navigating Stress
3. Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) for Building Mental Resilience and Positive Mindset
4. Online Community Space for resources and a space to share stories

TTPs are being used in this project in a similar fashion as the MITRE Att&ck to help cyber security professionals relate to have an execution path that they can apply to their daily lives. 

Project roadmap
After approval of the project the Github Discussion is being started with the topics mentioned above. 

We will populate background information to the project to raise awareness and build the TTPs gradually.
